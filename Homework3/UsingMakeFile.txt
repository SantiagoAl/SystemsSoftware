To use the make file attached in files section, make sure you add the names of all your .c files to the following line:
SRC_CODE =
and all the corresponding object files (.o files which will be generated by make utility) to following line:
SRC_OBJ =

For example, if you have three .c files named main.c, vm.c and scanner.c , you just have to edit two lines in the make file:
SRC_CODE = main.c vm.c scanner.c
SRC_OBJ = main.o vm.o scanner.o

You can compile your program by just typing make on the terminal, after navigating to the directory which contains all your .c files and the make file.
The make utility will produce an executable file : src_prog  ; which you can execute using ./src_prog input.txt -a -l -v

To remove the object files and executable created, you can use make clean command.
